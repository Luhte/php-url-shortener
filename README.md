# Simple URL Shortener

This project is a simple URL shortener built with PHP and MySQL. It allows users to enter a long URL and generates a shortened version that redirects to the original URL.

## Features

- Easy to use web interface for shortening URLs.
- Secure handling of URLs with PHP and MySQL to prevent SQL injections.
- Simple setup and minimal dependencies.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher
- Composer for managing PHP dependencies

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine or server:

```bash
git clone https://yourrepositoryurl.com/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run Composer to install the required PHP libraries:

```bash
composer install
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment

Copy the example environment configuration file and modify it to suit your environment:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your database connection details and other configurations:

```plaintext
DB_SERVER=localhost
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=url_shortener
```

### Step 4: Database Setup

Create your MySQL database and user, and grant the necessary permissions. Then, run the following SQL script to create the required table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE urls (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  short_code VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  long_url VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

### Step 5: Configure Your Web Server

Configure your web server to point to the public directory of this project. Ensure `.htaccess` (for Apache) or the equivalent configuration for nginx is set up to redirect requests to your `index.php` file.

Example for Apache `.htaccess`:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [L,QSA]
```

### Step 6: Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to the URL where the project is hosted. You should see the URL shortener interface.

## Usage

To use the URL shortener:

1. Enter a long URL into the input field.
2. Click the "Shorten" button.
3. The application will display a shortened URL.
4. Access the shortened URL in a browser to be redirected to the original URL.

## Security Measures

- The application uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Input validation ensures only valid URLs are processed.
